Task Completed

Hi, I have just finished all the tasks listed below. 
Here are some points about the work

1. Used SASS
2. No jQuery. Everything is pure javascript
3. Used Fetch API to read JSON data
4. Used bootstrap grid css for the layout

You need a live server to view the json data on the accordian and tabs.

If you have any questions let me know.

Thanks.

Faiza A.
